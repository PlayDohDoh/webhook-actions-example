# webhook-actions-example
An example Node.js server for handling Bavard webhook actions.

## Setup
Run `npm install`

## Start the server
```
npm run start
```

## Trigger a webhook action
Open a second command window and run the following command. 
```
npm run test
```
This triggers a webhook action the same way that Bavard chatbots do. Please see the file `test.ts`.
